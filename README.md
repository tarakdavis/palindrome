# Palindrome
A program that asks the user for one or more sentences and then lets the user know if it is a palindrome.

## Objectives
Understand how to manipulate strings
Understand how strings are related to lists
Understand recursion
Be able to strip characters out of strings
Be able to change the case of strings
Be able to look at substrings


## Files Included
A README.md file with a good description of the problem being solved.
A Python file named palindrome.py that contains your implementation.
A Python file named palindrome_test.py that contains the provided tests.


## Description
Program that, when run, asks the user to input some text. It can be a phrase, a sentence, or multiple sentences. After it is entered, the program will let the user know if it is a palindrome or not by printing "is a palindrome" or "is not a palindrome" in the output.

Letter casing and punctuation do not matter when testing a palindrome. All of the following are valid palindromes:

stunt nuts
Lisa Bonet ate no basil.
A man, a plan, a cat, a ham, a yak, a yam, a hat, a canal: Panama!
Doc, note, I dissent. A fast never prevents a fatness. I diet on cod.

Program passes all of the tests provided in palindrome_test.py.
